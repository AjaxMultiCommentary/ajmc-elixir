The _Ajax_ Multi-Commentary explores the notion of a digital commentary by focusing on one commentary’s tradition: that of Sophocles’ _Ajax_. Focusing on the historical and epistemological dimension of such publications, this project will study the history of this genre and of its exegetic practices. In order to enable the study of all published commentaries on the Ajax, digitized commentaries will be processed and transformed into a multi-commentary, enabling a comprehensive comparative analysis of the commentary tradition.

The commentary on commentaries that this project will this aims at studying, from a history of science point of view, how the various commentaries have contributed to shaping our reading and understanding of this text. This new commentary sets out to: a) reflect on the different practices of commentators; b) compare and examine different readings of the text; c) compare and discuss the choices of parallel passages; d) situate commentaries within their scholarly context.

This project will make the commentary tradition on the _Ajax_ more easily accessible for scholars and readers, it will address crucial technical challenges (e.g., lemma linkage, automatic markup, visualization of a multi-commentary) that concern virtually any digitized commentary, and have hitherto hindered the exploitation of thousands of digitized commentaries already in the public domain.
